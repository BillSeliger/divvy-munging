divvy-munging
=============

Merging pairwise station distances with 2013 trip data. The pairwise distance was created by Nick Bennet, and the SQL query to merge them by Eric Van Zanten. 

The file is Divvy_Trips_And_Distances_2013.csv and is 145 MB.

Important: The distance represents the Google Maps Bicycle directions distance for that station pair and no route was inspected before the algorithmâ€™s route was accepted into the dataset. 

Divvy released trip data for all trips taken by annual members and 24-hour pass holders for the 2013 operation year, which is June 28 to December 31. 

Distances are in meters unless marked otherwise. 
Station IDs in files in <data_from_divvy> folders do not match station IDs <data_from_others> folder.
